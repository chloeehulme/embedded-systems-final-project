- DC motor
- L298N Dual H-bridge motor driver
- Servo motor
- Ultrasonic sensor (H-SR04)
- Micro air pump
- Single channel relay
- Battery pack
- Joystick module
- Arduino nano
- Bluetooth module (HC-05)
- Particle Argon
- Raspberry Pi

## Usage
For implementing an automated cup and drink dispenser; designed specifically for those experiencing a loss of fine motor skills who may be 
unable to independently pour themselves a glass of water.
